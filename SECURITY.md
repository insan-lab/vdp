## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in InsanLab systems:

- **Preferred format**: clear description, steps to reproduce, and proof-of-concept if possible.  
- **Acknowledgement**: within **72 hours**.  
- **Status updates**: at least every **7 days** until resolution.

## What to Expect
- ‚úÖ Accepted reports will be investigated, patched, and you may receive public credit (if you wish).  
- ‚ùå Declined reports (non-exploitable, out of scope, or third-party) will include an explanation.  
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Harbor**: As long as testing is done in good faith, without data theft or service disruption, InsanLab will not pursue legal action.
